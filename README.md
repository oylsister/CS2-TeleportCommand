# CS2-TeleportCommand

 CS:Sharp Advanced teleport command plugin for Counter-Strike 2

 Please be advised, I haven't tested plugin yet. And this is the first my actual finished plugin that has been released. If you find any issues report in here.

 Similar to Teleport command from SourcePawn.

 ## Command ##
 `!tele` or `!teleport` [playername] [another_playername] for teleport player to another player.
 `!bring` [playername] for bring player to you.
 `!goto` [playername] for bring you to player. (Haven't started doing yet)

 playername as @ct @t or @all are worked (This is for temporary only).
